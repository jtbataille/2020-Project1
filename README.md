## General Info

Utilizes The Dog API and PetFinder API to allow a user to search for dogs in a selected state by either inputting a breed type or both a breed group and temperament. Users may alternatively select "Surpise Me" and a state to find a random dog.

## Technologies

* The Dog API
* PetFinder API
* Bootstrap 4.5
* jQuery
* Font Awesome

## Features

* Pulls dog breeds, information, and pictures from The Dog API
* Searches for selected breeds in specified state using PetFinder API

## How to Use

* The application has multiple options for searching for a dog:

    * Selecting a state and breed type
    
    * Selecting a state, breed group and/or temperament
    
    * Selecting a state and Surprise Me.

* Option 1: Upon entering the application, select a state, then type in a specific breed group (ex. Golden Retriever, Boxer, Bulldog, etc) and press the Submit button.

    * If a state or breed group is not selected, the user will receive an error message asking that they make the selection(s).

* Option 2: Upon entering the application, select a state, then select a breed type and/or temperment, and press the Submit button.

    * If a state, breed type, and/or temperament is not selected, the user will receive an error message asking that they make the selection(s).

* Option 3: Upon entering the application, select a state and then press the Surprise Me button.

    * If a state is not selected, the user will receive an error message asking that they make the selection.

* After performing one of the three options, one or more cards will appear, each with a picture of and information about a breed group.

* In each card will be a Select Me button. Choosing this button will cause dogs to appear in the Available Dogs box.

    * If the selected breed group is not available in the state chosen from the dropdown, an error message saying, "Breed group is not available in selected state. Please search again" will appear.

* After searching for a dog, the user may select either Yes or No for a specific search result.

    * Selecting Yes will either pull up one or more results with the dog breed in a selected state or will result in an error message saying that the selected dog breed is not available in that state.

    * Selecting No will clear all search results and search fields.

* When the user selects Yes for a specific breed and that breed is available in the selected state, the results with available dogs will display a picture of a dog, its primary and (if applicable) secodary breed, as well as a Pick Me! Pick Me! button.

* Selecting the Pick Me! Pick Me! will redirect the user to the PetFinder website where the user can view more information about the dog.

* If the user would like to perform a new search or select new fields, they may use the Clear button to empty all of the fields and remove any breed groups that may have appeared.

* If the user would like to return to the top of the site, they may click the Back to Search buttons to clear results and return to the top.

* If the user would like to clear their selections or begin a new search, they may choose the Clear button to clear the search results and search fields.
